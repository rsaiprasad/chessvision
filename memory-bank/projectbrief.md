# Chess Video Analysis Application - Project Brief

## Project Overview
This application analyzes chess games from video recordings, identifies the chess board, extracts positions, and tracks moves in real-time. It outputs the game in standard chess notation (PGN/FEN) as moves are made.

## Core Requirements
1. Process chess game videos (recorded files or streams)
2. Identify and extract the chess board from video frames
3. Recognize chess pieces and their positions
4. Track moves as they occur in the video
5. Output standard chess notation (PGN/FEN) for the game
6. Consider legal chess moves to improve move detection accuracy

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Python Library Development
- Create core video processing functionality
- Implement chess position extraction algorithms
- Develop move detection and tracking
- Build command-line utility for video input
- Display identified chess positions visually
- Output PGN/FEN as moves are detected

### Phase 2: Web Service Implementation
- Convert Python library to web service
- Accept video stream inputs
- Process video streams in real-time
- Provide API endpoints for position/move data
- Output FEN/PGN based on specified arguments

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
- Build React/TypeScript frontend with ShadCN UI
- Create dual-panel interface (video + chess board)
- Integrate with Lichess analysis board for position display
- Connect to backend web service via API
- Display real-time position updates

## Technical Architecture
- Backend: Python (separate package)
- Frontend: React/TypeScript with ShadCN UI (separate package)
- Frontend Build Tool: RSPack
- Integration: Web API connecting frontend and backend

## Success Criteria
- Accurate chess board detection in videos
- Reliable piece position extraction
- Correct move tracking and PGN generation
- Real-time processing capability
- Seamless integration between frontend and backend
