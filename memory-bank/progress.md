## Known Issues and Challenges

1. **Technical Challenges**
   - Ensuring smooth migration of existing code to new structure
   - Maintaining functionality during restructuring
   - Designing clean interfaces between components
   - Managing dependencies between components during development

2. **Implementation Risks**
   - Breaking existing functionality during migration
   - Introducing new bugs in restructured code
   - Ensuring consistent behavior across components
   - Managing increased complexity with three separate components

3. **Open Questions**
   - Best approach for dependency management between components
   - Testing strategy for the new structure
   - Deployment strategy for the three components
   - Development workflow across components

## Next Milestone Target

**Milestone: Project Restructuring**
- Target Completion: 2 weeks
- Key Deliverables:
  - New directory structure created
  - Core library migrated to new structure
  - Backend service skeleton implemented
  - Frontend application skeleton implemented
  - Basic integration between components

## Recent Achievements

- New three-component architecture designed
- Memory bank documentation updated to reflect new structure
- Migration plan created
- Interfaces between components defined

## Blockers

- None currently identified

## Notes and Observations

- The new structure will improve separation of concerns and maintainability
- The modular design will allow for independent development and deployment
- The clear interfaces between components will make the system more robust
- The restructuring is a necessary step before adding new features
