# Chess Video Analysis Application - Product Context

## Problem Statement
Chess players, coaches, and enthusiasts often record games for later analysis, but manually transcribing moves from videos is time-consuming and error-prone. Existing solutions either require specialized hardware (electronic boards) or manual input, creating barriers to efficient game analysis.

## Solution
This application automates the process of extracting chess positions and moves from video recordings. By leveraging computer vision and chess logic, it eliminates the need for manual transcription, allowing players to focus on analysis rather than data entry.

## Project Components

### Chess Vision Library (chess-vision-lib)
- Core functionality for chess video analysis
- Processes video files to extract chess positions and moves
- Generates PGN/FEN notation
- Provides visualization tools for debugging
- Can be used as a standalone library or integrated into other applications

### Chess Vision Service (chess-vision-service)
- Web service exposing library functionality via REST API
- Handles video stream processing
- Provides endpoints for position/move data
- Enables integration with web and mobile applications
- Manages authentication and authorization

### Chess Vision Web (chess-vision-web)
- Web interface for interacting with the service
- Provides video upload and streaming capabilities
- Displays chess positions alongside video
- Integrates with Lichess board for analysis
