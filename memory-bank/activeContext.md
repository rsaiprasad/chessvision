# Chess Video Analysis Application - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We have completed the initial implementation of **Phase 1: Python Library Development** of the Chess Video Analysis Application. The core functionality for processing chess videos, detecting boards, extracting positions, and tracking moves has been implemented.

### Phase 1 Implementation

1. **Core Video Processing Pipeline**
   - Implemented frame extraction from video files
   - Developed board detection algorithms

2. **Chess Position Extraction**
   - Implemented position extraction from board images
   - Added position validation using chess rules
   - Created visualization for detected positions

3. **Move Tracking**
   - Implemented move detection between consecutive positions
   - Added support for special moves (castling, en passant, promotion)
   - Created PGN/FEN generation

4. **Command-Line Interface**
   - Created a user-friendly CLI
   - Implemented video input handling
   - Added visual feedback mechanisms
   - Implemented output formatting for PGN/FEN

## Recent Changes

- Created project structure with all necessary modules
- Implemented core video processing pipeline
- Added board detection and normalization
- Implemented position extraction and validation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions

1. **Board Detection Approach**
   - Currently using contour detection with approximation
   - Need to evaluate performance with different board styles
   - Consider adding feature matching as an alternative approach

2. **Piece Recognition Strategy**
   - Current implementation uses basic image statistics
   - Need to implement template matching or machine learning approach
   - Consider creating a dataset of chess piece images

3. **Move Inference Logic**
   - Currently comparing board states and using chess rules
   - Need to improve handling of ambiguous moves
   - Consider adding confidence scores for detected moves

4. **Error Handling**
   - Basic error handling implemented
   - Need to add more robust recovery strategies
   - Consider adding logging for better debugging

### Open Questions

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - How to balance accuracy and processing speed?
   - Which steps in the pipeline can be optimized?
   - Are there opportunities for parallel processing?

2. **Robustness**
   - How to handle varying lighting conditions?
   - What strategies for different board and piece styles?
   - How to manage camera movement or perspective changes?

3. **User Experience**
   - What level of visual feedback is most helpful?
   - How to present errors or low-confidence detections?
   - What configuration options should be exposed to users?

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - What test datasets should be created?
   - How to measure accuracy of the system?
   - What benchmarks should be established?
